## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Description
The technology used in the application:
- Next.js
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

The reason behind this choice was primarily due to the need for server-side rendering and improved SEO. Next.js excels in delivering faster initial page loads, which is crucial for my content-heavy website. Additionally, Next.js being built on React provided the advantage of a robust component-based architecture and an extensive ecosystem. The full-stack capabilities of Next.js, including serverless functions and API routes, were also appealing for handling both client-side and server-side logic. While there was a learning curve and some complexity involved, the benefits of Next.js in terms of performance, scalability, and development experience made it the ideal choice for my web application

In choosing Tailwind CSS for my web application, I valued its utility-first approach and extensive pre-built classes for rapid styling. However, it's important to note the trade-offs. It may lead to larger file sizes and potentially less semantic markup. The initial learning curve to understand utility class naming and configuration is required. Tailwind CSS may limit design flexibility, and customization efforts can increase complexity. Nonetheless, the benefits of improved productivity, code maintainability, and consistent styling influenced my decision.

Using TypeScript in conjunction with Tailwind CSS brings advantages such as enhanced type safety, improved developer experience, better scalability, access to a rich ecosystem, and reduced runtime errors. However, it comes with a learning curve, slight compilation overhead, increased verbosity, and potential tooling limitations. Despite these trade-offs, the benefits of TypeScript, including improved code quality and productivity, make it a valuable choice for web development projects.
